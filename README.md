These are three templates that I hope to incorporate in our Open Door Toastmasters site. I have started with the Minutes template. As we progress, I hope to make the Feedback form functional.

minutes.html is a template for the latest meeting minutes that works on phones. Currently we are using .pdf files.
agenda.html file does the same for the current agenda. To make useful I will need to have it grab data from the opendoor website.
feedback.html allows members to send feedback to each other on speeches.
