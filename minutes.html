        Ashish Rajbar – Leadership Development – Project 3: Researching and
        presenting (5-7 mins) – “Happiness”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ashish explained how happiness comes from within. We need to focus on
        helping each other, volunteering and noticing all the good that
        surrounds us. Ultimately, it is our choice to face each day with
        gratitude; which is the key to a happy life.

            Smartphones assist in emergencies, employment and dating to name a
            few, but can be distracting and cause us to lose concentration if we
            allow it to. We can become addicted to its use and rely on it for
            everything. The bottom line is that smartphones are getting smarter
            and people are getting dumber.</p>
