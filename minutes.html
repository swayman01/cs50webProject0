          Ashish explained how happiness comes from within. We need to focus on
          helping each other, volunteering and noticing all the good that
          surrounds us. Ultimately, it is our choice to face each day with
          gratitude; which is the key to a happy life.

              Smartphones assist in emergencies, employment and dating to name a
              few, but can be distracting and cause us to lose concentration if we
              allow it to. We can become addicted to its use and rely on it for
              everything. The bottom line is that smartphones are getting smarter
              and people are getting dumber.
